# Project 5, Sprint 10: Around The U.S. + World

This project refactors [the original](https://hcqpersonal.github.io/web_project_4/dist) to utilize React.

**Fresh Tech**
React

**Original Stack**
HTML | CSS | JavaScript üç¶

**Description and updates plan**
The last version focused on ensuring it was responsive to desktop and mobile, got profile information and images via API, and had functioning popups. I've now recreated the ability to post profile updates, add/like/delete images, and show like counts from classmates.

# CRA
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**
If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.
You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
